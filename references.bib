  abstract = {Abstract             Several artificial intelligence algorithms have been developed for COVID-19-related topics. One that has been common is the COVID-19 diagnosis using chest X-rays, where the eagerness to obtain early results has triggered the construction of a series of datasets where bias management has not been thorough from the point of view of patient information, capture conditions, class imbalance, and careless mixtures of multiple datasets. This paper analyses 19 datasets of COVID-19 chest X-ray images, identifying potential biases. Moreover, computational experiments were conducted using one of the most popular datasets in this domain, which obtains a 96.19\% of classification accuracy on the complete dataset. Nevertheless, when evaluated with the ethical tool Aequitas, it fails on all the metrics. Ethical tools enhanced with some distribution and image quality considerations are the keys to developing or choosing a dataset with fewer bias issues. We aim to provide broad research on dataset problems, tools, and suggestions for future dataset developments and COVID-19 applications using chest X-ray images.},

This book provides a firm foundation in the mathematical tools used to model the measurements and derive the reconstruction algorithms used in most of these modalities. The text uses X-ray computed tomography (X-ray CT) as a 'pedagogical machine' to illustrate important ideas and its extensive discussion of background material makes the more advanced mathematical topics accessible to people with a less formal mathematical education. This new edition contains a chapter on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a revised section on the relationship between the continuum and discrete Fourier transforms, an improved description of the gridding method, and new sections on both Grangreat's formula and noise analysis in MR-imaging. Mathematical concepts are illuminated with over 200 illustrations and numerous exercises},
